description: My presentation in Sansari Mai School, Sindhupalchok, Nepal
---


## Introduction:

I went to visit Nepal in January 2018 after three years after coming to US in January 2015. It was a great relief to see my family and friends in good condition even after a devastating earthquake in April 2015.


I have a friend named Deepak Bomjan who is from Yamuna dada, Sindhupalchok district, which is nearly four hours treacherous driving towards east from Kathmandu. Plus, you need to walk two hours uphill to reach his exact home. I decided to go for hiking to his village with him. Fortunately, he has a relative who is a principal in a school named Sansari Mai High School in his village. I had always dreamt of inspiring students and create awareness about scope of Computer Science. So, I also decided to give a presentation to the students from that school. I believe this made our journey more purposeful.
