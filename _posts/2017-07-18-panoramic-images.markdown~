## Introduction:

In this blog, I want to show few panoramic images that I've
been taking in the periphery of my Lamar University. I am doing this in order to
upload in google maps, so that prospective students of Lamar University
can have close feel of this university.


I believe, my contributions of these panoramic images to google maps can help and guide 
someone who is far away from this university. They can have a up-close look at this university environment 
(interior and exterior). I have tried to cover as much facilities as I can.
In this collection, you can get the 3D images of Recreational Center, Terrell park, Tennis court,
Library, Cherry Engineering building and others.

I will be taking images and uploading to Google maps till I'm in Beaumont.

Thank you.

PS. Please click on the map below to view the images.
