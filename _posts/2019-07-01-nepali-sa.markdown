description: "Aspect Based Abusive Sentiment Detection in Nepali Social Media Texts"
---
This project is my second project in Nepali language. I tried to combine
Named Entity Recognition and Sentiment Analysis tasks together in this project.

### Abstract
With the increase in internet access and
the ease of writing comments in the Nepali language,
fine-grained sentiment analysis of social media comments is becoming more and more pertinent. There are
a number of benchmarked datasets for high-resource
languages (English, French, and German) in specific
domains like restaurants, hotels or electronic goods but
not in low-resource languages like Nepali. In this paper,
we present our work to create a dataset for the targeted
aspect-based sentiment analysis in the social media
domain, set up a dataset benchmark and evaluate
using various machine learning models. The dataset
comprises of code-mixed and code-switched comments
extracted from Nepali YouTube videos. We present
convincing baselines using a multilingual BERT model
for the Aspect Term Extraction task and BiLSTM
model for the Sentiment Classification Task achieving
57.978% and 81.60% F1 score respectively.


## Tasks
We divided the experiments into two sub-tasks: Aspect Term Extraction and Sentiment Polarity Identification.

Aspect Term Extraction resembles the sequence labeling task where we tag each token of a given sentence with
predefined aspect category or named entities. We experiment with four major categories General, Profanity, Violence, Feedback under Aspect Category and Person, Organization, Location and Miscellaneous under Target Entities.

Sentiment Polarity Identification is a binary classification task to identify sentiment polarity [0, 1] of each
aspect categories in every given sentence.
