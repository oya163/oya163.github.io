## Introduction:

This is my first blog on my own webpage, although I've written few other blogs in my Google blogspot.
Since I'm not finding any interesting topic to start with, I am writing
about a cooking project which my friend (Kiran) and I did for fun.

We made CARROT'S HALUWA (Gaajar ko haluwa, as called in Hindi/Nepali). This is sweet delicacy
which is very popular in Middle East, Asia and Africa (according to Wikipedia). You can call it
sweets or desserts if you want to explain it to an American. 

This haluwa is very popular in Nepal as well and everybody loves it especially who loves sweets.
Anyway, I will explain the procedure that we followed to prepare this dish.

## Procedures:

1. Peel the carrots outer-cover.
2. Grate the carrots. 
3. Cook carrots in melted butter and stir it up time and again.
4. Pour enough milk to cover all the carrots.
5. Add sugar to taste.
6. You can add raisins, saffron, cashew nuts, pistachios, almonds, cardamoms.
7. Keep boiling the mixture and stirring till it becomes thick and soft.
8. After the mixture has become thick, let it cool.
9. The halwa is ready.

        <p>This task is mundane and back-breaking. It took me more than half an hour, 
		because there were lots of carrots, approximately 15 pieces. </p>

        <p>This is my friend cooking grated carrots. She took more than an hour, I believe, to prepare this dish.
		This is more excruciating task which needs more patience and attention. Her energy and enthusiasm must be appreciated
		for preparing this haluwa meticulously.</p>
