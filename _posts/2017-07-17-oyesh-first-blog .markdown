## Introduction:

This is my first blog on my own webpage. I've written few other blogs in Google blogspot.
Therefore, since I'm not finding any interesting topic to start with, I will write
about a cooking project that Kiran (my friend) and I did for fun.

We made CARROT'S HALWA (Gaajar ko haluwa, as called in Hindi/Nepali). This is sweet delicacy
which is very popular in Middle East, Asia and Africa, according to Wikipedia. You can call it
sweets or desserts if you want to explain to an American. 

This halva is very popular in Nepal as well and everybody loves it, who loves sweets.
Anyway, I will explain the procedure that we followed to prepare this dish.
