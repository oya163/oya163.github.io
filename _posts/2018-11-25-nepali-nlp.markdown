description: "Main goal is to classify Nepali documents into various categories"
---

Since there is very less research in Nepali language, I wanted to initiate some research into Nepali
language starting with text classification. My goal is to work with Hierarchical Attention Network
to classify the news documents written in Nepali language into various categories like Sports,
Business, Politics and 13 other categories. I have learned about text preprocess and corpus creation for Nepali language.

  - Ensemble Learning (Gradient Boosting, Bagging)
  - Perceptron
  - MLP
- [x] Deep Learning
  - RNN
  - LSTM
  - GRU
- [x] Data Visualization
