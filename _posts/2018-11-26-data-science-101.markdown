description: "Text preprocessing, Machine Learning and Data Visualization"
---

We formed a group who are interested in Data Science and interested to get internship in the same.
We meet every evening in the library to work on Kaggle Competition. Currently, we are onto Movie Sentiment Analysis.
We do rigorous study behind the machine learning algorithms.
