We formed a group who are interested in Data Science and interested to get internship in the same field. We meet every evening in the library to work on Kaggle Competition. We finished working on Movie Sentiment Analysis. Currently, we are working on Quora insincere question analysis. We are doing rigorous (theoretical and practical) study behind the machine learning algorithms.
