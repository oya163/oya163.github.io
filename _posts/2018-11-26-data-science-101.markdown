description: "Text preprocessing, Machine Learning and Data Visualization"
---

We formed a group of students who are interested in Data Science and interested to get internship in the same field.
We meet every evening in the library to work on Kaggle Competition. Currently, we are working on Text Classification related with Movie Sentiment Analysis.
We are doing rigorous (theoretical and practical) study behind the machine learning algorithms.
