Hello, I am Oyesh Mann Singh. I am from Nepal, a small country between India and China. Nepal is famous for Mountains.


Fun fact: 8 out of top 10 highest mountains in the world, lies in Nepal.


Currently, I am a recent graduate student from University of Maryland Baltimore County. I am fortunate to work under the supervision of [Dr. Anupam Joshi](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/~joshi) on two projects, Named Entity Recognition in Nepali Language and Aspect Based Abusive Sentiment Detection in Nepali Social Media Texts. I am proud to have worked on Nepali language, as it is my native language and first such projects in Nepali NLP community.
