Currently, I am a graduate student in University of Maryland Baltimore County. I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Anupam Joshi](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/~joshi/) on two projects, Named Entity Recognition in Nepali Language and Aspect Based Abusive Sentiment Detection in Nepali Social Media Texts. I am proud to have worked on Nepali language, as it is my native language and first such projects in Nepali NLP community.
